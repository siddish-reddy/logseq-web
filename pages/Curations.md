#### [The Good Try Rule - LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MGWEztZY8GZ5im4x7/the-good-try-rule)
	- So when someone says “try Vim or try Roam Research”, ^^its a lazy advice^^;
	- Instead they should have said to try Roam Research for a week and dump your thoughts without worrying about the structure or format.
	- This way at least you wont be hating whatever X they suggested in the first place.
